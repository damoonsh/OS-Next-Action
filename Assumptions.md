- The OpenRouter API key is passed to the shell as `AK`.
- The events being passed are stored in temporary cache and will be written to the persistant storage
- Data from persistent storage is used for ranking; XGBRanker with query group of last action.
- All actions have params, some may be empty.
- If action does not occur, the ranking value will be low and the LLM will replace with sth more sensical.
- Random synthizing of user events could mimic the actual randomness of real-world user behaviour.
